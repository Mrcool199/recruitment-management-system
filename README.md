# recruitment-management-system
Project Description
I have created a task management application for the recruitment process. 
I used java and html
1. I have created a CRUD functionality for the User where you can create, read, update and delete.
2. I have implement sorting options for the lists of Users and Tasks,
allowing sorting by user and tasks.
3. I have include a feature to mark a Task as complete in the list.
5. I have displayed the current weather in the header of all pages.

How to launch:
run the java project called StudentManagementSystem 
Open your browser and type in "http://localhost:8080/students"

Why I chose the selection of programming language and framework:
Java and HTML are commonly used together in web development. Java is utilized for backend logic, handling business processes, and interacting with databases. HTML, on the other hand, structures the content of web pages, defining the UI and content presentation. They are integrated using web frameworks like Spring or JSF, enabling dynamic web pages. This combination facilitates full-stack development, reusability, and modularity. Java and HTML have broad adoption and community support, making them powerful tools for building interactive and scalable web applications with a clear separation of concerns.
